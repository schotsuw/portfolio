## Description

After learning basic web development including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to learn more about ReactJS which provides me many helpful functionalities. I wanted to build a website that can show things about myself. Therefore, this portfolio website represents my backgrounds, experiences, skills, and personal projects. It also has a form for sending me emails if you have any questions.
